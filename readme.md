# WLR089 Code
This repository contains my modified code derrived from the LoRa P2P repository https://github.com/MicrochipTech/atsamr34_long_range_p2p/tree/master/02_getting_started

## Changes
I have modified src/main.c and src/p2p_demo.c
In this modified version, upon SW0 being pressed on one board, it toggles a constant PWM signal on GPIO pin PA08
